# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the XiaoMa-Cli framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the XiaoMa-Cli framework.

# Game Development BMad Knowledge Base

## Overview

This game development expansion of XiaoMa-Cli specializes in creating 2D games using Phaser 3 and TypeScript. It extends the core BMad framework with game-specific agents, workflows, and best practices for professional game development.

### Game Development Focus

- **Target Engine**: Phaser 3.70+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- **Platform Strategy**: Web-first with mobile optimization
- **Development Approach**: Agile story-driven development
- **Performance Target**: 60 FPS on target devices
- **Architecture**: Component-based game systems

## Core Game Development Philosophy

### Player-First Development

You are developing games as a "Player Experience CEO" - thinking like a game director with unlimited creative resources and a singular vision for player enjoyment. Your AI agents are your specialized game development team:

- **Direct**: Provide clear game design vision and player experience goals
- **Refine**: Iterate on gameplay mechanics until they're compelling
- **Oversee**: Maintain creative alignment across all development disciplines
- **Playfocus**: Every decision serves the player experience

### Game Development Principles

1. **PLAYER_EXPERIENCE_FIRST**: Every mechanic must serve player engagement and fun
2. **ITERATIVE_DESIGN**: Prototype, test, refine - games are discovered through iteration
3. **TECHNICAL_EXCELLENCE**: 60 FPS performance and cross-platform compatibility are non-negotiable
4. **STORY_DRIVEN_DEV**: Game features are implemented through detailed development stories
5. **BALANCE_THROUGH_DATA**: Use metrics and playtesting to validate game balance
6. **DOCUMENT_EVERYTHING**: Clear specifications enable proper game implementation
7. **START_SMALL_ITERATE_FAST**: Core mechanics first, then expand and polish
8. **EMBRACE_CREATIVE_CHAOS**: Games evolve - adapt design based on what's fun

## Game Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Game Concept and Design

1. **Game Designer**: Start with brainstorming and concept development
   - Use \*brainstorm to explore game concepts and mechanics
   - Create Game Brief using game-brief-tmpl
   - Develop core game pillars and player experience goals

2. **Game Designer**: Create comprehensive Game Design Document
   - Use game-design-doc-tmpl to create detailed GDD
   - Define all game mechanics, progression, and balance
   - Specify technical requirements and platform targets

3. **Game Designer**: Develop Level Design Framework
   - Create level-design-doc-tmpl for content guidelines
   - Define level types, difficulty progression, and content structure
   - Establish performance and technical constraints for levels

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture

4. **Solution Architect** (or Game Designer): Create Technical Architecture
   - Use game-architecture-tmpl to design technical implementation
   - Define Phaser 3 systems, performance optimization, and code structure
   - Align technical architecture with game design requirements

### Phase 3: Story-Driven Development

5. **Game Scrum Master**: Break down design into development stories
   - Use create-game-story task to create detailed implementation stories
   - Each story should be immediately actionable by game developers
   - Apply game-story-dod-checklist to ensure story quality

6. **Game Developer**: Implement game features story by story
   - Follow TypeScript strict mode and Phaser 3 best practices
   - Maintain 60 FPS performance target throughout development
   - Use test-driven development for game logic components

7. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous playtesting and improvement
   - Test core mechanics early and often
   - Validate game balance through metrics and player feedback
   - Iterate on design based on implementation discoveries

# Advanced Game Design Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance game design content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of game mechanics and player experience through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple game development perspectives
- Apply game-specific critical thinking to design decisions

## Task Instructions

### 1. Game Design Context and Review

[[LLM: When invoked after outputting a game design section:

1. First, provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented, with game-specific focus (e.g., "Please review the core mechanics for player engagement and implementation feasibility. Pay special attention to how these mechanics create the intended player experience and whether they're technically achievable with Phaser 3.")

2. If the section contains game flow diagrams, level layouts, or system diagrams, explain each diagram briefly with game development context before offering elicitation options (e.g., "The gameplay loop diagram shows how player actions lead to rewards and progression. Notice how each step maintains player engagement and creates opportunities for skill development.")

3. If the section contains multiple game elements (like multiple mechanics, multiple levels, multiple systems, etc.), inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual game elements within the section (specify which element when selecting an action)

4. Then present the action list as specified below.]]

### 2. Ask for Review and Present Game Design Action List

[[LLM: Ask the user to review the drafted game design section. In the SAME message, inform them that they can suggest additions, removals, or modifications, OR they can select an action by number from the 'Advanced Game Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions'. If there are multiple game elements in the section, mention they can specify which element(s) to apply the action to. Then, present ONLY the numbered list (0-9) of these actions. Conclude by stating that selecting 9 will proceed to the next section. Await user selection. If an elicitation action (0-8) is chosen, execute it and then re-offer this combined review/elicitation choice. If option 9 is chosen, or if the user provides direct feedback, proceed accordingly.]]

**Present the numbered list (0-9) with this exact format:**

```text
**Advanced Game Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions**
Choose an action (0-9 - 9 to bypass - HELP for explanation of these options):

0. Expand or Contract for Target Audience
1. Explain Game Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
2. Critique and Refine from Player Perspective
3. Analyze Game Flow and Mechanic Dependencies
4. Assess Alignment with Player Experience Goals
5. Identify Potential Player Confusion and Design Risks
6. Challenge from Critical Game Design Perspective
7. Explore Alternative Game Design Approaches
8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' Game Design Reflection
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

### 2. Processing Guidelines

**Do NOT show:**

- The full protocol text with `[[LLM: ...]]` instructions
- Detailed explanations of each option unless executing or the user asks, when giving the definition you can modify to tie its game development relevance
- Any internal template markup

**After user selection from the list:**

- Execute the chosen action according to the game design protocol instructions below
- Ask if they want to select another action or proceed with option 9 once complete
- Continue until user selects option 9 or indicates completion

## Game Design Action Definitions

0. Expand or Contract for Target Audience
   [[LLM: Ask the user whether they want to 'expand' on the game design content (add more detail, elaborate on mechanics, include more examples) or 'contract' it (simplify mechanics, focus on core features, reduce complexity). Also, ask if there's a specific player demographic or experience level they have in mind (casual players, hardcore gamers, children, etc.). Once clarified, perform the expansion or contraction from your current game design role's perspective, tailored to the specified player audience if provided.]]

1. Explain Game Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
   [[LLM: Explain the step-by-step game design thinking process that you used to arrive at the current proposal for this game content. Focus on player psychology, engagement mechanics, technical feasibility, and how design decisions support the overall player experience goals.]]

2. Critique and Refine from Player Perspective
   [[LLM: From your current game design role's perspective, review your last output or the current section for potential player confusion, engagement issues, balance problems, or areas for improvement. Consider how players will actually interact with and experience these systems, then suggest a refined version that better serves player enjoyment and understanding.]]

3. Analyze Game Flow and Mechanic Dependencies
   [[LLM: From your game design role's standpoint, examine the content's structure for logical gameplay progression, mechanic interdependencies, and player learning curve. Confirm if game elements are introduced in an effective order that teaches players naturally and maintains engagement throughout the experience.]]

4. Assess Alignment with Player Experience Goals
   [[LLM: Evaluate how well the current game design content contributes to the stated player experience goals and core game pillars. Consider whether the mechanics actually create the intended emotions and engagement patterns. Identify any misalignments between design intentions and likely player reactions.]]

5. Identify Potential Player Confusion and Design Risks
   [[LLM: Based on your game design expertise, brainstorm potential sources of player confusion, overlooked edge cases in gameplay, balance issues, technical implementation risks, or unintended player behaviors that could emerge from the current design. Consider both new and experienced players' perspectives.]]

6. Challenge from Critical Game Design Perspective
   [[LLM: Adopt a critical game design perspective on the current content. If the user specifies another viewpoint (e.g., 'as a casual player', 'as a speedrunner', 'as a mobile player', 'as a technical implementer'), critique the content from that specified perspective. If no other role is specified, play devil's advocate from your game design expertise, arguing against the current design proposal and highlighting potential weaknesses, player experience issues, or implementation challenges. This can include questioning scope creep, unnecessary complexity, or features that don't serve the core player experience.]]

7. Explore Alternative Game Design Approaches
   [[LLM: From your game design role's perspective, first broadly brainstorm a range of diverse approaches to achieving the same player experience goals or solving the same design challenge. Consider different genres, mechanics, interaction models, or technical approaches. Then, from this wider exploration, select and present 2-3 distinct alternative design approaches, detailing the pros, cons, player experience implications, and technical feasibility you foresee for each.]]

8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' Game Design Reflection
   [[LLM: In your current game design persona, imagine this is a postmortem for a shipped game based on the current design content. What's the one 'if only we had designed/considered/tested X...' that your role would highlight from a game design perspective? Include the imagined player reactions, review scores, or development consequences. This should be both insightful and somewhat humorous, focusing on common game design pitfalls.]]

9. Proceed / No Further Actions
   [[LLM: Acknowledge the user's choice to finalize the current game design work, accept the AI's last output as is, or move on to the next step without selecting another action from this list. Prepare to proceed accordingly.]]

## Game Development Context Integration

This elicitation task is specifically designed for game development and should be used in contexts where:

- **Game Mechanics Design**: When defining core gameplay systems and player interactions
- **Player Experience Planning**: When designing for specific emotional responses and engagement patterns
- **Technical Game Architecture**: When balancing design ambitions with implementation realities
- **Game Balance and Progression**: When designing difficulty curves and player advancement systems
- **Platform Considerations**: When adapting designs for different devices and input methods

The questions and perspectives offered should always consider:

- Player psychology and motivation
- Technical feasibility with Phaser 3 and TypeScript
- Performance implications for 60 FPS targets
- Cross-platform compatibility (desktop and mobile)
- Game development best practices and common pitfalls

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .xiaoma-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Document an Existing Project

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive documentation for existing projects optimized for AI development agents. This task creates structured reference materials that enable AI agents to understand project context, conventions, and patterns for effective contribution to any codebase.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Initial Project Analysis

**CRITICAL:** First, check if a PRD or requirements document exists in context. If yes, use it to focus your documentation efforts on relevant areas only.

**IF PRD EXISTS**:

- Review the PRD to understand what enhancement/feature is planned
- Identify which modules, services, or areas will be affected
- Focus documentation ONLY on these relevant areas
- Skip unrelated parts of the codebase to keep docs lean

**IF NO PRD EXISTS**:
Ask the user:

"I notice you haven't provided a PRD or requirements document. To create more focused and useful documentation, I recommend one of these options:

1. **Create a PRD first** - Would you like me to help create a brownfield PRD before documenting? This helps focus documentation on relevant areas.

2. **Provide existing requirements** - Do you have a requirements document, epic, or feature description you can share?

3. **Describe the focus** - Can you briefly describe what enhancement or feature you're planning? For example:
   - 'Adding payment processing to the user service'
   - 'Refactoring the authentication module'
   - 'Integrating with a new third-party API'

4. **Document everything** - Or should I proceed with comprehensive documentation of the entire codebase? (Note: This may create excessive documentation for large projects)

Please let me know your preference, or I can proceed with full documentation if you prefer."

Based on their response:

- If they choose option 1-3: Use that context to focus documentation
- If they choose option 4 or decline: Proceed with comprehensive analysis below

Begin by conducting analysis of the existing project. Use available tools to:

1. **Project Structure Discovery**: Examine the root directory structure, identify main folders, and understand the overall organization
2. **Technology Stack Identification**: Look for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, etc. to identify languages, frameworks, and dependencies
3. **Build System Analysis**: Find build scripts, CI/CD configurations, and development commands
4. **Existing Documentation Review**: Check for README files, docs folders, and any existing documentation
5. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Sample key files to understand coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural approaches

Ask the user these elicitation questions to better understand their needs:

- What is the primary purpose of this project?
- Are there any specific areas of the codebase that are particularly complex or important for agents to understand?
- What types of tasks do you expect AI agents to perform on this project? (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring, testing)
- Are there any existing documentation standards or formats you prefer?
- What level of technical detail should the documentation target? (junior developers, senior developers, mixed team)
- Is there a specific feature or enhancement you're planning? (This helps focus documentation)

### 2. Deep Codebase Analysis

CRITICAL: Before generating documentation, conduct extensive analysis of the existing codebase:

1. **Explore Key Areas**:
   - Entry points (main files, index files, app initializers)
   - Configuration files and environment setup
   - Package dependencies and versions
   - Build and deployment configurations
   - Test suites and coverage

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**:
   - "I see you're using [technology X]. Are there any custom patterns or conventions I should document?"
   - "What are the most critical/complex parts of this system that developers struggle with?"
   - "Are there any undocumented 'tribal knowledge' areas I should capture?"
   - "What technical debt or known issues should I document?"
   - "Which parts of the codebase change most frequently?"

3. **Map the Reality**:
   - Identify ACTUAL patterns used (not theoretical best practices)
   - Find where key business logic lives
   - Locate integration points and external dependencies
   - Document workarounds and technical debt
   - Note areas that differ from standard patterns

**IF PRD PROVIDED**: Also analyze what would need to change for the enhancement

### 3. Core Documentation Generation

[[LLM: Generate a comprehensive BROWNFIELD architecture document that reflects the ACTUAL state of the codebase.

**CRITICAL**: This is NOT an aspirational architecture document. Document what EXISTS, including:

- Technical debt and workarounds
- Inconsistent patterns between different parts
- Legacy code that can't be changed
- Integration constraints
- Performance bottlenecks

**Document Structure**:

# [Project Name] Brownfield Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document captures the CURRENT STATE of the [Project Name] codebase, including technical debt, workarounds, and real-world patterns. It serves as a reference for AI agents working on enhancements.

### Document Scope

[If PRD provided: "Focused on areas relevant to: {enhancement description}"]
[If no PRD: "Comprehensive documentation of entire system"]

### Change Log

| Date   | Version | Description                 | Author    |
| ------ | ------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| [Date] | 1.0     | Initial brownfield analysis | [Analyst] |

## Quick Reference - Key Files and Entry Points

### Critical Files for Understanding the System

- **Main Entry**: `src/index.js` (or actual entry point)
- **Configuration**: `config/app.config.js`, `.env.example`
- **Core Business Logic**: `src/services/`, `src/domain/`
- **API Definitions**: `src/routes/` or link to OpenAPI spec
- **Database Models**: `src/models/` or link to schema files
- **Key Algorithms**: [List specific files with complex logic]

### If PRD Provided - Enhancement Impact Areas

[Highlight which files/modules will be affected by the planned enhancement]

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

### Actual Tech Stack (from package.json/requirements.txt)

| Category  | Technology | Version | Notes                      |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| Runtime   | Node.js    | 16.x    | [Any constraints]          |
| Framework | Express    | 4.18.2  | [Custom middleware?]       |
| Database  | PostgreSQL | 13      | [Connection pooling setup] |

etc...

### Repository Structure Reality Check

- Type: [Monorepo/Polyrepo/Hybrid]
- Package Manager: [npm/yarn/pnpm]
- Notable: [Any unusual structure decisions]

## Source Tree and Module Organization

### Project Structure (Actual)

```text
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/     # HTTP request handlers
│   ├── services/        # Business logic (NOTE: inconsistent patterns between user and payment services)
│   ├── models/          # Database models (Sequelize)
│   ├── utils/           # Mixed bag - needs refactoring
│   └── legacy/          # DO NOT MODIFY - old payment system still in use
├── tests/               # Jest tests (60% coverage)
├── scripts/             # Build and deployment scripts
└── config/              # Environment configs
```

### Key Modules and Their Purpose

- **User Management**: `src/services/userService.js` - Handles all user operations
- **Authentication**: `src/middleware/auth.js` - JWT-based, custom implementation
- **Payment Processing**: `src/legacy/payment.js` - CRITICAL: Do not refactor, tightly coupled
- **[List other key modules with their actual files]**

## Data Models and APIs

### Data Models

Instead of duplicating, reference actual model files:

- **User Model**: See `src/models/User.js`
- **Order Model**: See `src/models/Order.js`
- **Related Types**: TypeScript definitions in `src/types/`

### API Specifications

- **OpenAPI Spec**: `docs/api/openapi.yaml` (if exists)
- **Postman Collection**: `docs/api/postman-collection.json`
- **Manual Endpoints**: [List any undocumented endpoints discovered]

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Critical Technical Debt

1. **Payment Service**: Legacy code in `src/legacy/payment.js` - tightly coupled, no tests
2. **User Service**: Different pattern than other services, uses callbacks instead of promises
3. **Database Migrations**: Manually tracked, no proper migration tool
4. **[Other significant debt]**

### Workarounds and Gotchas

- **Environment Variables**: Must set `NODE_ENV=production` even for staging (historical reason)
- **Database Connections**: Connection pool hardcoded to 10, changing breaks payment service
- **[Other workarounds developers need to know]**

## Integration Points and External Dependencies

### External Services

| Service  | Purpose  | Integration Type | Key Files                      |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Stripe   | Payments | REST API         | `src/integrations/stripe/`     |
| SendGrid | Emails   | SDK              | `src/services/emailService.js` |

etc...

### Internal Integration Points

- **Frontend Communication**: REST API on port 3000, expects specific headers
- **Background Jobs**: Redis queue, see `src/workers/`
- **[Other integrations]**

## Development and Deployment

### Local Development Setup

1. Actual steps that work (not ideal steps)
2. Known issues with setup
3. Required environment variables (see `.env.example`)

### Build and Deployment Process

- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (webpack config in `webpack.config.js`)
- **Deployment**: Manual deployment via `scripts/deploy.sh`
- **Environments**: Dev, Staging, Prod (see `config/environments/`)

## Testing Reality

### Current Test Coverage

- Unit Tests: 60% coverage (Jest)
- Integration Tests: Minimal, in `tests/integration/`
- E2E Tests: None
- Manual Testing: Primary QA method

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test           # Runs unit tests
npm run test:integration  # Runs integration tests (requires local DB)
```

## If Enhancement PRD Provided - Impact Analysis

### Files That Will Need Modification

Based on the enhancement requirements, these files will be affected:

- `src/services/userService.js` - Add new user fields
- `src/models/User.js` - Update schema
- `src/routes/userRoutes.js` - New endpoints
- [etc...]

### New Files/Modules Needed

- `src/services/newFeatureService.js` - New business logic
- `src/models/NewFeature.js` - New data model
- [etc...]

### Integration Considerations

- Will need to integrate with existing auth middleware
- Must follow existing response format in `src/utils/responseFormatter.js`
- [Other integration points]

## Appendix - Useful Commands and Scripts

### Frequently Used Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm run build       # Production build
npm run migrate     # Run database migrations
npm run seed        # Seed test data
```

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

- **Logs**: Check `logs/app.log` for application logs
- **Debug Mode**: Set `DEBUG=app:*` for verbose logging
- **Common Issues**: See `docs/troubleshooting.md`]]

### 4. Document Delivery

1. **In Web UI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude)**:
   - Present the entire document in one response (or multiple if too long)
   - Tell user to copy and save as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` or `docs/project-architecture.md`
   - Mention it can be sharded later in IDE if needed

2. **In IDE Environment**:
   - Create the document as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
   - Inform user this single document contains all architectural information
   - Can be sharded later using PO agent if desired

The document should be comprehensive enough that future agents can understand:

- The actual state of the system (not idealized)
- Where to find key files and logic
- What technical debt exists
- What constraints must be respected
- If PRD provided: What needs to change for the enhancement]]

### 5. Quality Assurance

CRITICAL: Before finalizing the document:

1. **Accuracy Check**: Verify all technical details match the actual codebase
2. **Completeness Review**: Ensure all major system components are documented
3. **Focus Validation**: If user provided scope, verify relevant areas are emphasized
4. **Clarity Assessment**: Check that explanations are clear for AI agents
5. **Navigation**: Ensure document has clear section structure for easy reference

Apply the advanced elicitation task after major sections to refine based on user feedback.

## Success Criteria

- Single comprehensive brownfield architecture document created
- Document reflects REALITY including technical debt and workarounds
- Key files and modules are referenced with actual paths
- Models/APIs reference source files rather than duplicating content
- If PRD provided: Clear impact analysis showing what needs to change
- Document enables AI agents to navigate and understand the actual codebase
- Technical constraints and "gotchas" are clearly documented

## Notes

- This task creates ONE document that captures the TRUE state of the system
- References actual files rather than duplicating content when possible
- Documents technical debt, workarounds, and constraints honestly
- For brownfield projects with PRD: Provides clear enhancement impact analysis
- The goal is PRACTICAL documentation for AI agents doing real work

# Facilitate Brainstorming Session Task

Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions with users. Be creative and adaptive in applying techniques.

## Process

### Step 1: Session Setup

Ask 4 context questions (don't preview what happens next):

1. What are we brainstorming about?
2. Any constraints or parameters?
3. Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?
4. Do you want a structured document output to reference later? (Default Yes)

### Step 2: Present Approach Options

After getting answers to Step 1, present 4 approach options (numbered):

1. User selects specific techniques
2. Analyst recommends techniques based on context
3. Random technique selection for creative variety
4. Progressive technique flow (start broad, narrow down)

### Step 3: Execute Techniques Interactively

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

- **FACILITATOR ROLE**: Guide user to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples
- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Keep user engaged with chosen technique until they want to switch or are satisfied
- **CAPTURE OUTPUT**: If (default) document output requested, capture all ideas generated in each technique section to the document from the beginning.

**Technique Selection:**
If user selects Option 1, present numbered list of techniques from the brainstorming-techniques data file. User can select by number..

**Technique Execution:**

1. Apply selected technique according to data file description
2. Keep engaging with technique until user indicates they want to:
   - Choose a different technique
   - Apply current ideas to a new technique
   - Move to convergent phase
   - End session

**Output Capture (if requested):**
For each technique used, capture:

- Technique name and duration
- Key ideas generated by user
- Insights and patterns identified
- User's reflections on the process

### Step 4: Session Flow

1. **Warm-up** (5-10 min) - Build creative confidence
2. **Divergent** (20-30 min) - Generate quantity over quality
3. **Convergent** (15-20 min) - Group and categorize ideas
4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Refine and develop concepts

### Step 5: Document Output (if requested)

Generate structured document with these sections:

**Executive Summary**

- Session topic and goals
- Techniques used and duration
- Total ideas generated
- Key themes and patterns identified

**Technique Sections** (for each technique used)

- Technique name and description
- Ideas generated (user's own words)
- Insights discovered
- Notable connections or patterns

**Idea Categorization**

- **Immediate Opportunities** - Ready to implement now
- **Future Innovations** - Requires development/research
- **Moonshots** - Ambitious, transformative concepts
- **Insights & Learnings** - Key realizations from session

**Action Planning**

- Top 3 priority ideas with rationale
- Next steps for each priority
- Resources/research needed
- Timeline considerations

**Reflection & Follow-up**

- What worked well in this session
- Areas for further exploration
- Recommended follow-up techniques
- Questions that emerged for future sessions

## Key Principles

- **YOU ARE A FACILITATOR**: Guide the user to brainstorm, don't brainstorm for them (unless they request it persistently)
- **INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE**: Ask questions, wait for responses, build on their ideas
- **ONE TECHNIQUE AT A TIME**: Don't mix multiple techniques in one response
- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Stay with one technique until user wants to switch
- **DRAW IDEAS OUT**: Use prompts and examples to help them generate their own ideas
- **REAL-TIME ADAPTATION**: Monitor engagement and adjust approach as needed
- Maintain energy and momentum
- Defer judgment during generation
- Quantity leads to quality (aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes)
- Build on ideas collaboratively
- Document everything in output document

## Advanced Engagement Strategies

**Energy Management**

- Check engagement levels: "How are you feeling about this direction?"
- Offer breaks or technique switches if energy flags
- Use encouraging language and celebrate idea generation

**Depth vs. Breadth**

- Ask follow-up questions to deepen ideas: "Tell me more about that..."
- Use "Yes, and..." to build on their ideas
- Help them make connections: "How does this relate to your earlier idea about...?"

**Transition Management**

- Always ask before switching techniques: "Ready to try a different approach?"
- Offer options: "Should we explore this idea deeper or generate more alternatives?"
- Respect their process and timing

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

   - "How might [genre A] mechanics work in [genre B]?"
   - Puzzle mechanics in action games
   - Dating sim elements in strategy games
   - Horror elements in racing games
   - Educational content in roguelike structure

3. **Player Motivation Reversal**
   [[LLM: Flip traditional player motivations to reveal new gameplay possibilities.]]
   - What if losing was the goal?
   - What if cooperation was forced in competitive games?
   - What if players had to help their enemies?
   - What if progress meant giving up abilities?

4. **Core Loop Deconstruction**
   [[LLM: Break down successful games to fundamental mechanics and rebuild differently.]]
   - What are the essential 3 actions in this game type?
   - How could we make each action more interesting?
   - What if we changed the order of these actions?
   - What if players could skip or automate certain actions?

#### Mechanic Innovation Frameworks

1. **SCAMPER for Game Mechanics**
   [[LLM: Guide through each SCAMPER prompt specifically for game design.]]
   - **S** = Substitute: What mechanics can be substituted? (walking → flying → swimming)

   - **A** = Adapt: What mechanics from other media? (books, movies, sports)
   - **M** = Modify/Magnify: What can be exaggerated? (super speed, massive scale)
   - **P** = Put to other uses: What else could this mechanic do? (jumping → attacking)
   - **E** = Eliminate: What can be removed? (UI, tutorials, fail states)
   - **R** = Reverse/Rearrange: What sequence changes? (end-to-start, simultaneous)

2. **Player Agency Spectrum**
   [[LLM: Explore different levels of player control and agency across game systems.]]
   - Full Control: Direct character movement, combat, building
   - Indirect Control: Setting rules, giving commands, environmental changes

# Game Development Guidelines

## Overview

This document establishes coding standards, architectural patterns, and development practices for 2D game development using Phaser 3 and TypeScript. These guidelines ensure consistency, performance, and maintainability across all game development stories.

## TypeScript Standards

### Strict Mode Configuration

**Required tsconfig.json settings:**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
  }
}
```

### Type Definitions

**Game Object Interfaces:**

```typescript
// Core game entity interface
interface GameEntity {
  readonly id: string;
  position: Phaser.Math.Vector2;
  active: boolean;
  destroy(): void;
}

// Player controller interface
interface PlayerController {
  readonly inputEnabled: boolean;
  handleInput(input: InputState): void;
  update(delta: number): void;
}

// Game system interface
interface GameSystem {
  readonly name: string;
  initialize(): void;
  update(delta: number): void;
  shutdown(): void;
}
```

**Scene Data Interfaces:**

```typescript
// Scene transition data
interface SceneData {
  [key: string]: any;
}

// Game state interface
interface GameState {
  currentLevel: number;
  score: number;
  lives: number;
  settings: GameSettings;
}

interface GameSettings {
  musicVolume: number;
  sfxVolume: number;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'normal' | 'hard';
  controls: ControlScheme;
}
```

### Naming Conventions

**Classes and Interfaces:**

- PascalCase for classes: `PlayerSprite`, `GameManager`, `AudioSystem`
- PascalCase with 'I' prefix for interfaces: `IGameEntity`, `IPlayerController`
- Descriptive names that indicate purpose: `CollisionManager` not `CM`

**Methods and Variables:**

- camelCase for methods and variables: `updatePosition()`, `playerSpeed`
- Descriptive names: `calculateDamage()` not `calcDmg()`
- Boolean variables with is/has/can prefix: `isActive`, `hasCollision`, `canMove`

**Constants:**

- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants: `MAX_PLAYER_SPEED`, `DEFAULT_VOLUME`
- Group related constants in enums or const objects

**Files and Directories:**

- kebab-case for file names: `player-controller.ts`, `audio-manager.ts`
- PascalCase for scene files: `MenuScene.ts`, `GameScene.ts`

## Phaser 3 Architecture Patterns

### Scene Organization

**Scene Lifecycle Management:**

```typescript
class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  private gameManager!: GameManager;
  private inputManager!: InputManager;

  constructor() {
    super({ key: 'GameScene' });
  }

  preload(): void {
    // Load only scene-specific assets
    this.load.image('player', 'assets/player.png');
  }

  create(data: SceneData): void {
    // Initialize game systems
    this.gameManager = new GameManager(this);
    this.inputManager = new InputManager(this);

    // Set up scene-specific logic
    this.setupGameObjects();
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }

  update(time: number, delta: number): void {
    // Update all game systems
    this.gameManager.update(delta);
    this.inputManager.update(delta);
  }

  shutdown(): void {
    // Clean up resources
    this.gameManager.destroy();
    this.inputManager.destroy();

    // Remove event listeners
    this.events.off('*');
  }
}
```

**Scene Transitions:**

```typescript
// Proper scene transitions with data
this.scene.start('NextScene', {
  playerScore: this.playerScore,
  currentLevel: this.currentLevel + 1,
});

// Scene overlays for UI
this.scene.launch('PauseMenuScene');
this.scene.pause();
```

### Game Object Patterns

**Component-Based Architecture:**

```typescript
// Base game entity
abstract class GameEntity extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite {
  protected components: Map<string, GameComponent> = new Map();

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, x: number, y: number, texture: string) {
    super(scene, x, y, texture);
    scene.add.existing(this);
  }

  addComponent<T extends GameComponent>(component: T): T {
    this.components.set(component.name, component);
    return component;
  }

  getComponent<T extends GameComponent>(name: string): T | undefined {
    return this.components.get(name) as T;
  }

  update(delta: number): void {
    this.components.forEach((component) => component.update(delta));
  }

  destroy(): void {
    this.components.forEach((component) => component.destroy());
    this.components.clear();
    super.destroy();
  }
}

// Example player implementation
class Player extends GameEntity {
  private movement!: MovementComponent;
  private health!: HealthComponent;

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, x: number, y: number) {
    super(scene, x, y, 'player');

    this.movement = this.addComponent(new MovementComponent(this));
    this.health = this.addComponent(new HealthComponent(this, 100));
  }
}
```

### System Management

**Singleton Managers:**

```typescript
class GameManager {
  private static instance: GameManager;
  private scene: Phaser.Scene;
  private gameState: GameState;

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene) {
    if (GameManager.instance) {
      throw new Error('GameManager already exists!');
    }

    this.scene = scene;
    this.gameState = this.loadGameState();
    GameManager.instance = this;
  }

  static getInstance(): GameManager {
    if (!GameManager.instance) {
      throw new Error('GameManager not initialized!');
    }
    return GameManager.instance;
  }

  update(delta: number): void {
    // Update game logic
  }

  destroy(): void {
    GameManager.instance = null!;
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Object Pooling

**Required for High-Frequency Objects:**

```typescript
class BulletPool {
  private pool: Bullet[] = [];
  private scene: Phaser.Scene;

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, initialSize: number = 50) {
    this.scene = scene;

    // Pre-create bullets
    for (let i = 0; i < initialSize; i++) {
      const bullet = new Bullet(scene, 0, 0);
      bullet.setActive(false);
      bullet.setVisible(false);
      this.pool.push(bullet);
    }
  }

  getBullet(): Bullet | null {
    const bullet = this.pool.find((b) => !b.active);
    if (bullet) {
      bullet.setActive(true);
      bullet.setVisible(true);
      return bullet;
    }

    // Pool exhausted - create new bullet
    console.warn('Bullet pool exhausted, creating new bullet');
    return new Bullet(this.scene, 0, 0);
  }

  releaseBullet(bullet: Bullet): void {
    bullet.setActive(false);
    bullet.setVisible(false);
    bullet.setPosition(0, 0);
  }
}
```

### Frame Rate Optimization

**Performance Monitoring:**

```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private frameCount: number = 0;
  private lastTime: number = 0;
  private frameRate: number = 60;

  update(time: number): void {
    this.frameCount++;

    if (time - this.lastTime >= 1000) {
      this.frameRate = this.frameCount;
      this.frameCount = 0;
      this.lastTime = time;

      if (this.frameRate < 55) {
        console.warn(`Low frame rate detected: ${this.frameRate} FPS`);
        this.optimizePerformance();
      }
    }
  }

  private optimizePerformance(): void {
    // Reduce particle counts, disable effects, etc.
  }
}
```

**Update Loop Optimization:**

```typescript
// Avoid expensive operations in update loops
class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  private updateTimer: number = 0;
  private readonly UPDATE_INTERVAL = 100; // ms

  update(time: number, delta: number): void {
    // High-frequency updates (every frame)
    this.updatePlayer(delta);
    this.updatePhysics(delta);

    // Low-frequency updates (10 times per second)
    this.updateTimer += delta;
    if (this.updateTimer >= this.UPDATE_INTERVAL) {
      this.updateUI();
      this.updateAI();
      this.updateTimer = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

## Input Handling

### Cross-Platform Input

**Input Abstraction:**

```typescript
interface InputState {
  moveLeft: boolean;
  moveRight: boolean;
  jump: boolean;
  action: boolean;
  pause: boolean;
}

class InputManager {
  private inputState: InputState = {
    moveLeft: false,
    moveRight: false,
    jump: false,
    action: false,
    pause: false,
  };

  private keys!: { [key: string]: Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Key };
  private pointer!: Phaser.Input.Pointer;

  constructor(private scene: Phaser.Scene) {
    this.setupKeyboard();
    this.setupTouch();
  }

  private setupKeyboard(): void {
    this.keys = this.scene.input.keyboard.addKeys('W,A,S,D,SPACE,ESC,UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT');
  }

  private setupTouch(): void {
    this.scene.input.on('pointerdown', this.handlePointerDown, this);
    this.scene.input.on('pointerup', this.handlePointerUp, this);
  }

  update(): void {
    // Update input state from multiple sources
    this.inputState.moveLeft = this.keys.A.isDown || this.keys.LEFT.isDown;
    this.inputState.moveRight = this.keys.D.isDown || this.keys.RIGHT.isDown;
    this.inputState.jump = Phaser.Input.Keyboard.JustDown(this.keys.SPACE);
    // ... handle touch input
  }

  getInputState(): InputState {
    return { ...this.inputState };
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

**Asset Loading Error Handling:**

```typescript
class AssetManager {
  loadAssets(): Promise<void> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.scene.load.on('filecomplete', this.handleFileComplete, this);
      this.scene.load.on('loaderror', this.handleLoadError, this);
      this.scene.load.on('complete', () => resolve());

      this.scene.load.start();
    });
  }

  private handleLoadError(file: Phaser.Loader.File): void {
    console.error(`Failed to load asset: ${file.key}`);

    // Use fallback assets
    this.loadFallbackAsset(file.key);
  }

  private loadFallbackAsset(key: string): void {
    // Load placeholder or default assets
    switch (key) {
      case 'player':
        this.scene.load.image('player', 'assets/defaults/default-player.png');
        break;
      default:
        console.warn(`No fallback for asset: ${key}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Runtime Error Recovery

**System Error Handling:**

```typescript
class GameSystem {
  protected handleError(error: Error, context: string): void {
    console.error(`Error in ${context}:`, error);

    // Report to analytics/logging service
    this.reportError(error, context);

    // Attempt recovery
    this.attemptRecovery(context);
  }

  private attemptRecovery(context: string): void {
    switch (context) {
      case 'update':
        // Reset system state
        this.reset();
        break;
      case 'render':
        // Disable visual effects
        this.disableEffects();
        break;
      default:
        // Generic recovery
        this.safeShutdown();
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Standards

### Unit Testing

**Game Logic Testing:**

```typescript
// Example test for game mechanics
describe('HealthComponent', () => {
  let healthComponent: HealthComponent;

  beforeEach(() => {
    const mockEntity = {} as GameEntity;
    healthComponent = new HealthComponent(mockEntity, 100);
  });

  test('should initialize with correct health', () => {
    expect(healthComponent.currentHealth).toBe(100);
    expect(healthComponent.maxHealth).toBe(100);
  });

  test('should handle damage correctly', () => {
    healthComponent.takeDamage(25);
    expect(healthComponent.currentHealth).toBe(75);
    expect(healthComponent.isAlive()).toBe(true);
  });

  test('should handle death correctly', () => {
    healthComponent.takeDamage(150);
    expect(healthComponent.currentHealth).toBe(0);
    expect(healthComponent.isAlive()).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

**Scene Testing:**

```typescript
describe('GameScene Integration', () => {
  let scene: GameScene;
  let mockGame: Phaser.Game;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Mock Phaser game instance
    mockGame = createMockGame();
    scene = new GameScene();
  });

  test('should initialize all systems', () => {
    scene.create({});

    expect(scene.gameManager).toBeDefined();
    expect(scene.inputManager).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

# Advanced Game Design Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance game design content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of game mechanics and player experience through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple game development perspectives
- Apply game-specific critical thinking to design decisions

## Task Instructions

### 1. Game Design Context and Review

[[LLM: When invoked after outputting a game design section:

1. First, provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented, with game-specific focus (e.g., "Please review the core mechanics for player engagement and implementation feasibility. Pay special attention to how these mechanics create the intended player experience and whether they're technically achievable with Phaser 3.")

2. If the section contains game flow diagrams, level layouts, or system diagrams, explain each diagram briefly with game development context before offering elicitation options (e.g., "The gameplay loop diagram shows how player actions lead to rewards and progression. Notice how each step maintains player engagement and creates opportunities for skill development.")

3. If the section contains multiple game elements (like multiple mechanics, multiple levels, multiple systems, etc.), inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual game elements within the section (specify which element when selecting an action)

4. Then present the action list as specified below.]]

### 2. Ask for Review and Present Game Design Action List

[[LLM: Ask the user to review the drafted game design section. In the SAME message, inform them that they can suggest additions, removals, or modifications, OR they can select an action by number from the 'Advanced Game Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions'. If there are multiple game elements in the section, mention they can specify which element(s) to apply the action to. Then, present ONLY the numbered list (0-9) of these actions. Conclude by stating that selecting 9 will proceed to the next section. Await user selection. If an elicitation action (0-8) is chosen, execute it and then re-offer this combined review/elicitation choice. If option 9 is chosen, or if the user provides direct feedback, proceed accordingly.]]

**Present the numbered list (0-9) with this exact format:**

```text
**Advanced Game Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions**
Choose an action (0-9 - 9 to bypass - HELP for explanation of these options):

0. Expand or Contract for Target Audience
1. Explain Game Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
2. Critique and Refine from Player Perspective
3. Analyze Game Flow and Mechanic Dependencies
4. Assess Alignment with Player Experience Goals
5. Identify Potential Player Confusion and Design Risks
6. Challenge from Critical Game Design Perspective
7. Explore Alternative Game Design Approaches
8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' Game Design Reflection
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

### 2. Processing Guidelines

**Do NOT show:**

- The full protocol text with `[[LLM: ...]]` instructions
- Detailed explanations of each option unless executing or the user asks, when giving the definition you can modify to tie its game development relevance
- Any internal template markup

**After user selection from the list:**

- Execute the chosen action according to the game design protocol instructions below
- Ask if they want to select another action or proceed with option 9 once complete
- Continue until user selects option 9 or indicates completion

## Game Design Action Definitions

0. Expand or Contract for Target Audience
   [[LLM: Ask the user whether they want to 'expand' on the game design content (add more detail, elaborate on mechanics, include more examples) or 'contract' it (simplify mechanics, focus on core features, reduce complexity). Also, ask if there's a specific player demographic or experience level they have in mind (casual players, hardcore gamers, children, etc.). Once clarified, perform the expansion or contraction from your current game design role's perspective, tailored to the specified player audience if provided.]]

1. Explain Game Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
   [[LLM: Explain the step-by-step game design thinking process that you used to arrive at the current proposal for this game content. Focus on player psychology, engagement mechanics, technical feasibility, and how design decisions support the overall player experience goals.]]

2. Critique and Refine from Player Perspective
   [[LLM: From your current game design role's perspective, review your last output or the current section for potential player confusion, engagement issues, balance problems, or areas for improvement. Consider how players will actually interact with and experience these systems, then suggest a refined version that better serves player enjoyment and understanding.]]

3. Analyze Game Flow and Mechanic Dependencies
   [[LLM: From your game design role's standpoint, examine the content's structure for logical gameplay progression, mechanic interdependencies, and player learning curve. Confirm if game elements are introduced in an effective order that teaches players naturally and maintains engagement throughout the experience.]]

4. Assess Alignment with Player Experience Goals
   [[LLM: Evaluate how well the current game design content contributes to the stated player experience goals and core game pillars. Consider whether the mechanics actually create the intended emotions and engagement patterns. Identify any misalignments between design intentions and likely player reactions.]]

5. Identify Potential Player Confusion and Design Risks
   [[LLM: Based on your game design expertise, brainstorm potential sources of player confusion, overlooked edge cases in gameplay, balance issues, technical implementation risks, or unintended player behaviors that could emerge from the current design. Consider both new and experienced players' perspectives.]]

6. Challenge from Critical Game Design Perspective
   [[LLM: Adopt a critical game design perspective on the current content. If the user specifies another viewpoint (e.g., 'as a casual player', 'as a speedrunner', 'as a mobile player', 'as a technical implementer'), critique the content from that specified perspective. If no other role is specified, play devil's advocate from your game design expertise, arguing against the current design proposal and highlighting potential weaknesses, player experience issues, or implementation challenges. This can include questioning scope creep, unnecessary complexity, or features that don't serve the core player experience.]]

7. Explore Alternative Game Design Approaches
   [[LLM: From your game design role's perspective, first broadly brainstorm a range of diverse approaches to achieving the same player experience goals or solving the same design challenge. Consider different genres, mechanics, interaction models, or technical approaches. Then, from this wider exploration, select and present 2-3 distinct alternative design approaches, detailing the pros, cons, player experience implications, and technical feasibility you foresee for each.]]

8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' Game Design Reflection
   [[LLM: In your current game design persona, imagine this is a postmortem for a shipped game based on the current design content. What's the one 'if only we had designed/considered/tested X...' that your role would highlight from a game design perspective? Include the imagined player reactions, review scores, or development consequences. This should be both insightful and somewhat humorous, focusing on common game design pitfalls.]]

9. Proceed / No Further Actions
   [[LLM: Acknowledge the user's choice to finalize the current game design work, accept the AI's last output as is, or move on to the next step without selecting another action from this list. Prepare to proceed accordingly.]]

## Game Development Context Integration

This elicitation task is specifically designed for game development and should be used in contexts where:

- **Game Mechanics Design**: When defining core gameplay systems and player interactions

# Game Development BMad Knowledge Base

## Overview

This game development expansion of XiaoMa-Cli specializes in creating 2D games using Phaser 3 and TypeScript. It extends the core BMad framework with game-specific agents, workflows, and best practices for professional game development.

### Game Development Focus

- **Target Engine**: Phaser 3.70+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- **Platform Strategy**: Web-first with mobile optimization
- **Development Approach**: Agile story-driven development
- **Performance Target**: 60 FPS on target devices
- **Architecture**: Component-based game systems

## Core Game Development Philosophy

### Player-First Development

You are developing games as a "Player Experience CEO" - thinking like a game director with unlimited creative resources and a singular vision for player enjoyment. Your AI agents are your specialized game development team:

- **Direct**: Provide clear game design vision and player experience goals
- **Refine**: Iterate on gameplay mechanics until they're compelling
- **Oversee**: Maintain creative alignment across all development disciplines
- **Playfocus**: Every decision serves the player experience

### Game Development Principles

1. **PLAYER_EXPERIENCE_FIRST**: Every mechanic must serve player engagement and fun
2. **ITERATIVE_DESIGN**: Prototype, test, refine - games are discovered through iteration
3. **TECHNICAL_EXCELLENCE**: 60 FPS performance and cross-platform compatibility are non-negotiable
4. **STORY_DRIVEN_DEV**: Game features are implemented through detailed development stories
5. **BALANCE_THROUGH_DATA**: Use metrics and playtesting to validate game balance
6. **DOCUMENT_EVERYTHING**: Clear specifications enable proper game implementation
7. **START_SMALL_ITERATE_FAST**: Core mechanics first, then expand and polish
8. **EMBRACE_CREATIVE_CHAOS**: Games evolve - adapt design based on what's fun

## Game Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Game Concept and Design

1. **Game Designer**: Start with brainstorming and concept development

3. **Game Designer**: Develop Level Design Framework
   - Create level-design-doc-tmpl for content guidelines
   - Define level types, difficulty progression, and content structure
   - Establish performance and technical constraints for levels

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture

4. **Solution Architect** (or Game Designer): Create Technical Architecture
   - Use game-architecture-tmpl to design technical implementation
   - Define Phaser 3 systems, performance optimization, and code structure
   - Align technical architecture with game design requirements

### Phase 3: Story-Driven Development

5. **Game Scrum Master**: Break down design into development stories
   - Use create-game-story task to create detailed implementation stories
   - Each story should be immediately actionable by game developers
   - Apply game-story-dod-checklist to ensure story quality

6. **Game Developer**: Implement game features story by story
   - Follow TypeScript strict mode and Phaser 3 best practices
   - Maintain 60 FPS performance target throughout development
   - Use test-driven development for game logic components

7. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous playtesting and improvement
   - Test core mechanics early and often
   - Validate game balance through metrics and player feedback
   - Iterate on design based on implementation discoveries

  readonly id: string;
  position: Phaser.Math.Vector2;
  active: boolean;
  destroy(): void;
}

// Player controller interface
interface PlayerController {
  readonly inputEnabled: boolean;

- Group related constants in enums or const objects

**Files and Directories:**

- kebab-case for file names: `player-controller.ts`, `audio-manager.ts`
- PascalCase for scene files: `MenuScene.ts`, `GameScene.ts`

## Phaser 3 Architecture Patterns

### Scene Organization

**Scene Lifecycle Management:**

```typescript
class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  private gameManager!: GameManager;
  private inputManager!: InputManager;

  constructor() {
    super({ key: 'GameScene' });
  }

  preload(): void {
    // Load only scene-specific assets
    this.load.image('player', 'assets/player.png');
  }

  create(data: SceneData): void {
    // Initialize game systems
    this.gameManager = new GameManager(this);
    this.inputManager = new InputManager(this);

    // Set up scene-specific logic
    this.setupGameObjects();
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }

  update(time: number, delta: number): void {
    // Update all game systems
    this.gameManager.update(delta);
    this.inputManager.update(delta);
  }

  shutdown(): void {
    // Clean up resources
    this.gameManager.destroy();
    this.inputManager.destroy();

    // Remove event listeners
    this.events.off('*');
  }
}
```

**Scene Transitions:**

```typescript
// Proper scene transitions with data
this.scene.start('NextScene', {
  playerScore: this.playerScore,
  currentLevel: this.currentLevel + 1,
});

// Scene overlays for UI
this.scene.launch('PauseMenuScene');
this.scene.pause();
```

### Game Object Patterns

**Component-Based Architecture:**

```typescript
// Base game entity
abstract class GameEntity extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite {
  protected components: Map<string, GameComponent> = new Map();

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, x: number, y: number, texture: string) {
    super(scene, x, y, texture);
    scene.add.existing(this);
  }

  addComponent<T extends GameComponent>(component: T): T {
    this.components.set(component.name, component);
    return component;
  }

  getComponent<T extends GameComponent>(name: string): T | undefined {
    return this.components.get(name) as T;
  }

  update(delta: number): void {
    this.components.forEach((component) => component.update(delta));
  }

  destroy(): void {
    this.components.forEach((component) => component.destroy());
    this.components.clear();
    super.destroy();
  }
}

// Example player implementation
class Player extends GameEntity {
  private movement!: MovementComponent;
  private health!: HealthComponent;

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, x: number, y: number) {
    super(scene, x, y, 'player');

    this.movement = this.addComponent(new MovementComponent(this));
    this.health = this.addComponent(new HealthComponent(this, 100));
  }
}
```

### System Management

**Singleton Managers:**

```typescript
class GameManager {
  private static instance: GameManager;
  private scene: Phaser.Scene;
  private gameState: GameState;

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene) {
    if (GameManager.instance) {
      throw new Error('GameManager already exists!');
    }

    this.scene = scene;
    this.gameState = this.loadGameState();
    GameManager.instance = this;
  }

  static getInstance(): GameManager {
    if (!GameManager.instance) {
      throw new Error('GameManager not initialized!');
    }
    return GameManager.instance;
  }

  update(delta: number): void {
    // Update game logic
  }

  destroy(): void {
    GameManager.instance = null!;
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Object Pooling

**Required for High-Frequency Objects:**

```typescript
class BulletPool {
  private pool: Bullet[] = [];
  private scene: Phaser.Scene;

  constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, initialSize: number = 50) {
    this.scene = scene;

    // Pre-create bullets
    for (let i = 0; i < initialSize; i++) {
      const bullet = new Bullet(scene, 0, 0);
      bullet.setActive(false);
      bullet.setVisible(false);
      this.pool.push(bullet);
    }
  }

  getBullet(): Bullet | null {
    const bullet = this.pool.find((b) => !b.active);
    if (bullet) {
      bullet.setActive(true);
      bullet.setVisible(true);
      return bullet;
    }

    // Pool exhausted - create new bullet
    console.warn('Bullet pool exhausted, creating new bullet');
    return new Bullet(this.scene, 0, 0);
  }

  releaseBullet(bullet: Bullet): void {
    bullet.setActive(false);
    bullet.setVisible(false);
    bullet.setPosition(0, 0);
  }
}
```

### Frame Rate Optimization

**Performance Monitoring:**

```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private frameCount: number = 0;
  private lastTime: number = 0;
  private frameRate: number = 60;

  update(time: number): void {
    this.frameCount++;

    if (time - this.lastTime >= 1000) {
      this.frameRate = this.frameCount;
      this.frameCount = 0;
      this.lastTime = time;

      if (this.frameRate < 55) {
        console.warn(`Low frame rate detected: ${this.frameRate} FPS`);
        this.optimizePerformance();
      }
    }
  }

  private optimizePerformance(): void {
    // Reduce particle counts, disable effects, etc.
  }
}
```

**Update Loop Optimization:**

```typescript
// Avoid expensive operations in update loops
class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  private updateTimer: number = 0;
  private readonly UPDATE_INTERVAL = 100; // ms

  update(time: number, delta: number): void {
    // High-frequency updates (every frame)
    this.updatePlayer(delta);
    this.updatePhysics(delta);

    // Low-frequency updates (10 times per second)
    this.updateTimer += delta;
    if (this.updateTimer >= this.UPDATE_INTERVAL) {
      this.updateUI();
      this.updateAI();
      this.updateTimer = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

## Input Handling

### Cross-Platform Input

**Input Abstraction:**

```typescript
interface InputState {
  moveLeft: boolean;
  moveRight: boolean;
  jump: boolean;
  action: boolean;
  pause: boolean;
}

class InputManager {
  private inputState: InputState = {
    moveLeft: false,
    moveRight: false,
    jump: false,
    action: false,
    pause: false,
  };

  private keys!: { [key: string]: Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Key };
  private pointer!: Phaser.Input.Pointer;

  constructor(private scene: Phaser.Scene) {
    this.setupKeyboard();
    this.setupTouch();
  }

  private setupKeyboard(): void {
    this.keys = this.scene.input.keyboard.addKeys('W,A,S,D,SPACE,ESC,UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT');
  }

  private setupTouch(): void {
    this.scene.input.on('pointerdown', this.handlePointerDown, this);
    this.scene.input.on('pointerup', this.handlePointerUp, this);
  }

  update(): void {
    // Update input state from multiple sources
    this.inputState.moveLeft = this.keys.A.isDown || this.keys.LEFT.isDown;
    this.inputState.moveRight = this.keys.D.isDown || this.keys.RIGHT.isDown;
    this.inputState.jump = Phaser.Input.Keyboard.JustDown(this.keys.SPACE);
    // ... handle touch input
  }

  getInputState(): InputState {
    return { ...this.inputState };
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

**Asset Loading Error Handling:**

```typescript
class AssetManager {
  loadAssets(): Promise<void> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.scene.load.on('filecomplete', this.handleFileComplete, this);
      this.scene.load.on('loaderror', this.handleLoadError, this);
      this.scene.load.on('complete', () => resolve());

      this.scene.load.start();
    });
  }

  private handleLoadError(file: Phaser.Loader.File): void {
    console.error(`Failed to load asset: ${file.key}`);

    // Use fallback assets
    this.loadFallbackAsset(file.key);
  }

  private loadFallbackAsset(key: string): void {
    // Load placeholder or default assets
    switch (key) {
      case 'player':
        this.scene.load.image('player', 'assets/defaults/default-player.png');
        break;
      default:
        console.warn(`No fallback for asset: ${key}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Runtime Error Recovery

**System Error Handling:**

```typescript
class GameSystem {
  protected handleError(error: Error, context: string): void {
    console.error(`Error in ${context}:`, error);

    // Report to analytics/logging service
    this.reportError(error, context);

    // Attempt recovery
    this.attemptRecovery(context);
  }

  private attemptRecovery(context: string): void {
    switch (context) {
      case 'update':
        // Reset system state
        this.reset();
        break;
      case 'render':
        // Disable visual effects
        this.disableEffects();
        break;
      default:
        // Generic recovery
        this.safeShutdown();
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Standards

### Unit Testing

**Game Logic Testing:**

```typescript
// Example test for game mechanics
describe('HealthComponent', () => {
  let healthComponent: HealthComponent;

  beforeEach(() => {
    const mockEntity = {} as GameEntity;
    healthComponent = new HealthComponent(mockEntity, 100);
  });

  test('should initialize with correct health', () => {
    expect(healthComponent.currentHealth).toBe(100);
    expect(healthComponent.maxHealth).toBe(100);
  });

  test('should handle damage correctly', () => {
    healthComponent.takeDamage(25);
    expect(healthComponent.currentHealth).toBe(75);
    expect(healthComponent.isAlive()).toBe(true);
  });

  test('should handle death correctly', () => {
    healthComponent.takeDamage(150);
    expect(healthComponent.currentHealth).toBe(0);
    expect(healthComponent.isAlive()).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

**Scene Testing:**

```typescript
describe('GameScene Integration', () => {
  let scene: GameScene;
  let mockGame: Phaser.Game;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Mock Phaser game instance
    mockGame = createMockGame();
    scene = new GameScene();
  });

  test('should initialize all systems', () => {
    scene.create({});

    expect(scene.gameManager).toBeDefined();
    expect(scene.inputManager).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

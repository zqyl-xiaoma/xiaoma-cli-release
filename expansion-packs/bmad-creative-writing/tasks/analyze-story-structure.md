# Analyze Story Structure

## Purpose

Perform comprehensive structural analysis of a narrative work to identify strengths, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities.

## Process

### 1. Identify Structure Type

- Three-act structure
- Five-act structure
- Hero's Journey
- Save the Cat beats
- Freytag's Pyramid
- Kishōtenketsu
- In medias res
- Non-linear/experimental

### 2. Map Key Points

- **Opening**: Hook, world establishment, character introduction
- **Inciting Incident**: What disrupts the status quo?
- **Plot Point 1**: What locks in the conflict?
- **Midpoint**: What reversal/revelation occurs?
- **Plot Point 2**: What raises stakes to maximum?
- **Climax**: How does central conflict resolve?
- **Resolution**: What new equilibrium emerges?

### 3. Analyze Pacing

- Scene length distribution
- Tension escalation curve
- Breather moment placement
- Action/reflection balance
- Chapter break effectiveness

### 4. Evaluate Setup/Payoff

- Track all setups (promises to reader)
- Verify each has satisfying payoff
- Identify orphaned setups
- Find unsupported payoffs
- Check Chekhov's guns

### 5. Assess Subplot Integration

- List all subplots
- Track intersection with main plot
- Evaluate resolution satisfaction
- Check thematic reinforcement

### 6. Generate Report

Create structural report including:

- Structure diagram
- Pacing chart
- Problem areas
- Suggested fixes
- Alternative structures

## Output

Comprehensive structural analysis with actionable recommendations

# Step 6: Build Complete Agent YAML

## STEP GOAL:

Generate the complete YAML agent file incorporating all discovered elements: purpose, persona, capabilities, name, and identity while maintaining the collaborative creation journey.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a YAML architect who transforms collaborative discoveries into technical implementation
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and identity, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring technical YAML expertise, user brings their agent vision, together we create complete agent configuration
- ✅ Maintain collaborative technical tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on generating complete YAML structure based on discovered elements
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to duplicate auto-injected features (help, exit, activation handlers)
- 💬 Approach: Present the journey of collaborative creation while building technical structure
- 📋 Generate YAML that accurately reflects all discoveries from previous steps

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Generate complete YAML structure based on agent type and discovered elements
- 💾 Present complete YAML with proper formatting and explanation
- 📖 Load appropriate template for agent type for structure guidance
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without incorporating all discovered elements

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: All discoveries from previous steps (purpose, persona, capabilities, identity)
- Focus: YAML generation and complete agent configuration
- Limits: No validation yet, just YAML generation
- Dependencies: Complete understanding of all agent characteristics from previous steps

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Celebrate the Journey

Present this to the user:

"Let's take a moment to appreciate what we've created together! Your agent started as an idea, and through our discovery process, it has developed into a fully-realized personality with clear purpose, capabilities, and identity."

**Journey Summary:**

- Started with purpose discovery (Step 2)
- Shaped personality through four-field persona system (Step 3)
- Built capabilities and command structure (Step 4)
- Established name and identity (Step 5)
- Ready to bring it all together in complete YAML

### 2. Load Agent Type Template

Based on determined agent type, load appropriate template:

- Simple Agent: `agent-complete-simple.md`
- Expert Agent: `agent-complete-expert.md`
- Module Agent: `agent-complete-module.md`

### 3. YAML Structure Generation

Explain the core structure to user:

"I'll now generate the complete YAML that incorporates everything we've discovered. This will include your agent's metadata, persona, capabilities, and configuration."

### 4. Generate Complete YAML

Create the complete YAML incorporating all discovered elements:

**Core Structure:**

- Agent metadata (name, title, icon, module, type)
- Complete persona (role, identity, communication_style, principles)
- Agent type-specific sections
- Command structure with proper references
- Output path configuration

Present the complete YAML to user:

"Here is your complete agent YAML, incorporating everything we've discovered together:

[Display complete YAML with proper formatting]

**Key Features Included:**

- Purpose-driven role and identity
- Distinct personality with four-field persona system
- All capabilities we discussed
- Proper command structure
- Agent type-specific optimizations
- Complete metadata and configuration

Does this capture everything we discussed?"

### 5. Agent Type Specific Implementation

Ensure proper implementation based on agent type:

**Simple Agent:**

- All capabilities in YAML prompts section
- No external file references
- Self-contained execution logic

**Expert Agent:**

- Sidecar file references for knowledge base
- Memory integration points
- Personal workflow capabilities

**Module Agent:**

- Workflow orchestration capabilities
- Team integration references
- Cross-agent coordination

### 6. Document Complete YAML

#### Content to Append (if applicable):

```markdown
## Complete Agent YAML

### Agent Type

[Simple/Expert/Module as determined]

### Generated Configuration

[Complete YAML structure with all discovered elements]

### Key Features Integrated

- Purpose and role from discovery phase
- Complete persona with four-field system
- All capabilities and commands developed
- Agent name and identity established
- Type-specific optimizations applied

### Output Configuration

[Proper file paths and configuration based on agent type]
```

Save this content to `{outputFile}` for reference.

### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask}
- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow}
- IF C: Save content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#7-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- After other menu items execution, return to this menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [complete YAML generated incorporating all discovered elements], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin validation.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Complete YAML structure generated for correct agent type
- All discovered elements properly integrated (purpose, persona, capabilities, identity)
- Commands correctly structured with proper workflow/action references
- Agent type specific optimizations implemented appropriately
- Output paths configured correctly based on agent type
- User confirms YAML captures all requirements from discovery process
- Content properly saved to output file
- Menu presented and user input handled correctly

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Duplicating auto-injected features (help, exit, activation handlers)
- Not incorporating all discovered elements from previous steps
- Invalid YAML syntax or structure
- Incorrect agent type implementation
- Missing user confirmation on YAML completeness

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
